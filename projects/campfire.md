    <h1>Campfire</h1>
    <p>Campfire was a creative group project that aimed to build a unique Social Immersive Media (SIM).</p>
    <p>This was a group assignment that focused on designing a around fixed limitation of hardware within 
open space while adhering to <a href="http://www.paulos.net/teaching/2009/AE/readings/protected/social-immersive-media-snibbe-chi09.pdf" target="_blank">SIM principles</a>.</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>With no design direction we began by coming up with way to work within our limitation. We designed game based our campfire, which resolved the range and fixed spacing, allowing for users to walk into and out of the interactive area.</p> 
<p>Once a users walks within range of the camera, their body is captured into the environment as a sasquatch avatar, and scaling to their height. They are tasked with keeping the camp fire going as things happen around them.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>
We created a great solution that worked around our hard limitation, that felt welcoming and very intuitive for use. If given another opportunity with todays new hardware, Iâ€™d love to refine the interaction adding more immersion. Using machine learning game engine that accounts for number of people within the given environment, and or adding overhead short throw projects with surround sound. </p>
